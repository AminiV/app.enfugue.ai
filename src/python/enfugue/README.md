# Enfugue Python Library

This is the Python library for enfugue.

There is a compilation step prior to installation, so simply installing this directory does *not* give you a working installation. See the top-level makefile for how static assets are compiled and amalgamated. Installing from Pip will always get you a working Enfugue installation.
